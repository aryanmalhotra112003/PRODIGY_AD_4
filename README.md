# 🕹️ Tic-Tac-Toe Game App

A minimal yet complete **Tic-Tac-Toe mobile game** built using **Flutter & Dart** as part of my internship with **Prodigy InfoTech**. This app offers a smooth, intuitive, and fun user experience — complete with real-time state updates, win/draw detection, and a sleek reset mechanism.

## 📱 Features

- 🎮 Classic **Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay** (X vs O)  
- 🧠 Intelligent **win/draw detection**  
- 🔁 Single-tap **Reset** functionality  
- ✨ Clean, responsive **UI with Provider state management**  
- 💡 Logical separation of UI and game logic for maintainability  
- 🧪 Exhaustively tested for all winning, draw, and edge cases  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Flutter** – for UI & cross-platform development  
- **Dart** – for backend logic & state updates  
- **Provider** – for efficient state management  
- **Android Studio / VS Code** – for development & debugging

## 🧪 Test Coverage

This app has been **exhaustively tested** under various conditions:

* ✅ All 8 winning combinations (rows, cols, diagonals)
* ✅ All 9 cells filled with no winner (Draw)
* ✅ Reset button working mid-game and post-game
* ✅ Alternating turns and prevention of overwriting moves
* ✅ Responsive layout and UI updates

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me:

* Apply state management with `Provider`
* Build responsive and reactive UIs with Flutter widgets
* Separate game logic from UI for modularity
* Test logical edge cases & handle UI updates correctly

✅ **Fix Summary:**  
The issue was due to four backticks (` ```` `) instead of three around the first code block. That caused Markdown to misinterpret where the code block ended.

You’re now good to go! Paste this as-is into your README file.
